<h1> Becoming (in)dividu </h1>
<p>
	The way Bernard Stiegler (1952) became philosopher has been particular as well as accidental. He speaks about this in a lecture entitled 

	<span class="bron"> <U>'Passer a l'acte' </U> <span class="footnote">| The text has been translated in Dutch 'Als een vliegende vis. Over de wording van een filosoof'. (2007). Garant. Antwerpen/Apeldoorn. |</span> </span>


	delivered in 2003 in Centre Pompidou, where he is head of the 'Institut de recherche et d'innovation'.  

	 

	I discovered his writings while studying at art academy and got fascinated by the close connection between the way he became philosopher and the content of his philosophy. As the title of the lecture shows it is while acting, where praxis and thinking connect, that his philosophy comes into being and has a relevant existence. Stiegler became philosopher by accident and in a way, in a necessary response to his 'acte'. 
</p>

<p class='element1'> 
	<span>The approach of Stiegler points in the direction of Derrida's critical concept of 'dividu'. A human is not a fixed, impermeable being, instead there are many, sometimes conflicting parts to what makes an individual. In his writings, Hodgkinsons opposes to the so called

	<span class="bron"> <U> 'myth of wholeness'</U> <span class="footnote"> | Hodgkinson, T. (2016) 'Music and the Myth of Wholeness: Towards a New Aesthetic Paradigm'. The MITT Press. Cambridge, Massachusetts. |</span> </span>

	His rationale points to the collision of aspects within human identity. While (inner) conflict as such does not necessarily negate the idea of wholeness, these discussions mainly show the need to broaden conceptualizations of the individual.</span> Wholeness is an ideal, which is reflected in the idea of a human having a single voice or identity.<span> While multiplicity and relationality are closer to reality as we experience it. 
</p>

<p>
	Instead of seeing it at as vocation, Stiegler demonstrates he became philosopher by accident. He committed an armed robbery when he was 26 years old, revolting against the capitalist system that dominates his country and was send to jail for 5 years. There he started studying and begun to write. This permitted him to reconstitute a surrounding in which life would be bearable. The act too laid the foundation for his thinking.
</p>

<p class='element2'>
	Stiegler calls after Blanchot (1969) the state of human existence a being in default of, which refers to the grand question of human origin, or 'la question de tout'. Because of the lack which characterizes human knowing of its origin, the search for this is what characterizes and directs our being.

	<p class='introductie'>
		Stiegler recreated in his prison cell an outside world, out of memory, fragmented parts, or remains, triggered by the philosophical texts he was reading. While rethinking concepts from classical philosophy, like anamnese, Stiegler rebuilt a relation to an outside that kept him from losing sanity. Instead of anamnese, which Plato believed to be an authentic memory giving access to original and true knowledge, Stiegler employs the term hypomnese. This way of remembering is from a classical Greek viewpoint seen as artificial, as opposed to the authentic, because it involves writing. 
</p>
	<p>
		Stiegler argues that this so called artificial way of relating is as much part of our human experience as the so called authentic way. If there is no such thing as origin, if the lack is characteristic, then hypomnetic aids, like scripture, or other tools and objects, are essential to our being. Seen from this perspective, the division between logos en techne is resolved. The technical forms a necessary part of us. Stiegler is best known for his work on this subject.
	</p>
<p class='element2'> 
		The title 'Passer a l'acte' 	
		shows the drive of Stieglers philosophy, namely as a meaning generating praxis which is undeniably connected to human's existential search. This search is an ongoing process, as is the so called process of individuation (inspired by Gilbert Simondon).
</p>

<p class='element1'> 
	<span> Becoming someone means living, means interacting, changing and transforming. Stiegler formulates this as becoming 'moi-autre'. This  </span>becoming 'moi-autre'<span> happens within self and at the same time in the external world of things and in connection to others. All selves form a </span> 'we'<span>, so individuation of </span>'I'<span> implies the individuation of 'we', and vice versa. 
</p>

<p>	
	The image of a flying fish, which is represented in the title of the Dutch translation of the lecture, is essential in this process. It shows a certain state of being, which permits humans to change and also to create. The fish leaving its surroundings makes it possible to realize that there even is such a thing as water.    
</p>

<p>
	In part, the individual is an accidental condensation which becomes while living. Meaning generation is inherent to living, out of need of a surrounding outside which permits the becoming 'moi-autre' and thus being. Yet sometimes the generation of meaning is consciously and explicitly taken up as a task and responsibility, as Stiegler did in his cell.    
</p>

<p>
	In a book which contains conversations between Stiegler and Elie During, Stiegler speaks about the way history and knowledge shape much of our individual lives.
	Being an individual means not only to have a personal past, but also being part of the collective past of mankind. The interconnectedness is part of our being, which Stiegler describes as a

	In French [donnent a un lieu son lieu], which points to being as an embodiment of the past.

	Edouard Glissant, Martinican poet, novelist and theorist, is an inspiring figure when exploring various conceptions of the individual. Fundamental principles in his oeuvre are relationality, permeability, opacity and flux. For anthropologists his work is especially interesting, as it, being labeled post-colonial, dissolves many dualities that have become all too familiar. I'd here like to quote at length a page titled
